# SAT_MAP_DATASET
This is a dataset for training neural networks consisting of image fragments cut simultaneously from different open services (Google satellite, Bing satellite, ESRI Satellite,google map,OSM, OSMHOT) and Mask images for segmentation



## Usage

This dataset is not final, as the segmentation masks will be improved.

This is a dataset for training neural networks consisting of image fragments cut simultaneously for different open services (Google satellite, Bing satellite, ESRI Satellite,google map,OSM, OSMHOT). Mask images for segmentation training are prepared in the seg catalog. This is a set of images where unnecessary objects and text from the maps are removed.


This dataset was created as part of the preparation of this article.
